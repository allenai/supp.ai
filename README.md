# supp.ai ðŸ’Š

An application that lets end users quickly search for and discover interactions
between supplements and pharmaceuticals.

## Getting Started

Fist, set your [Algolia Admin API key](https://www.algolia.com/apps/PEUZR5B1FW/api-keys/all):

```
~ export SUPP_AI_ALGOLIA_API_KEY=$YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

Then, make sure you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
installed locally and run:

```
~ docker-compose up --build
```

Once that command is complete, navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Verifying your Changes

There aren't any tests (yet) for the project. We do, however, have CI that
verifies some baseline assumptions about the state of the codebase. Before
submitting changes follow these steps:

1. Use `mypy` to statically analyze `api/` subproject:

    ```
    ~ ./bin/dev api types:check
    ```

2. Format the `api/` subproject:

    ```
    ~ ./bin/dev api format
    ```

3. Format the `ui/` subproject:

    ```
    ~ ./bin/dev ui format
    ```

## Updating the Data

To deploy new data, follow these steps:

1. Compress the datafiles using `tar` (there should be 3 files, `cui_metadata.json`,
  `sentence_dict.json` and `interaction_id_dict.json`). The `YYYY`, `MM` and `DD`
   below refer to the 4 digit year, 2 digit month and 2 digit date. The `NN` value
   is an index to allow for multiple data releases in a single day.

    ```
    ~ tar -cvjf YYYYMMDD_NN.tar.gz *.json
    ```

2. Upload them to [this GCS bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/supp-ai-data?project=ai2-reviz)
   and make them public (give `read` access to the `allUsers` User).

3. Update the `Dockerfile`, replacing the `DATA_ARCHIVE` value with the new
   archive name.

5. Start things locally to make sure everything works as expected:

    ```
    ~ docker-compose up --build
    ```

ðŸ’Š Happy supplement interaction finding!
